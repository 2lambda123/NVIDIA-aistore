#
# Pre-install hook with the highest weight, therefore run as the final pre-install
# hook. Since some other pre-install hooks are non-blocking (and may race with
# subsequent AIS pods in completing their work) this final hook is a synchronization
# opportunity. It is implemented via a Job (Helm treat this as blocking) which sleeps
# for a few seconds - pride be damned! Note that the delay here will be observed
# in the 'helm install' cmdline.
