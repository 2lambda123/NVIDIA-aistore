#
# Ubuntu 18.04 has some bug whereby specifying the mtu for a dhcp-configured
# interface in netplan fails, so we have to resort to some matching as below.
#
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    {{ item.interface }}:
      dhcp4: yes
      match:
        driver: {{ item.driver }}
      mtu: {{ item.mtu }}
