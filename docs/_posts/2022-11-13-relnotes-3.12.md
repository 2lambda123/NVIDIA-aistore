This AIStore release, version 3.12, has been in development for almost 4 months. It includes a number of significant changes that can be further detailed and grouped as follows:

* [v3.12 changelog](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/releases/tag/v1.3.15)

Some of the more conceptual changes are briefly described below.

# Remote AIS clusters

In AIS, remote buckets from different cloud (and non-cloud) providers, on the one hand, and from all inter-connected AIS clusters, on the other, form a _global namespace_ of _all_ buckets.

> To support global namespace, AIS assigns buckets `@`-prefixed UUID. For remote AIS clusters, the respective UUIDs and aliases can be used interchangeably.

To connect one cluster to another, we simply call `attach-remote-ais(URL, alias)` API, where URL is an access point (aka endpoint) provided by any gateway of the cluster in question.

Henceforth, for users the cluster remains known (addressable and accessible) by its given human-readable alias. AIStore, however, for any and all inter-cluster operations relies solely on the respective cluster's UUID.

Version 3.12 contains associated [improvements and bug fixes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/releases/tag/v1.3.15) but the most significant step-up is - consistent reliance on cluster UUIDs.

# Presence versus Existence

AIS completely hides the fact that a remote bucket may only be partially present, or may not be present at all, in the cluster.

Moreover, users can start reading, writing, listing, and otherwise operating on buckets that are totally unknown to AIS at the time of the first read, write, or list etc.

> When user references a new bucket, AIS behind the scenes looks it up, confirms its existence and accessibility, and - if confirmed - on-the-fly updates its own cluster-wide global metadata called `BMD`. The latter contains bucket definitions, associated management policies, and bucket properties.

There are cases, however, and scenarios when users may not be wanting, or meaning, to do any of the above - examples including:

* list only those buckets that are present in the cluster
* list only those objects that are present ("cached") in a bucket which is present in cluster

and so on.

To that end, AIS v3.12 introduces [presence](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/api/apc/query.go#L70) - an enumerated filter that can be used in API calls to override existing defaults (that hasn't changed).

All API changes are further referenced in the [changelog](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/releases/tag/v1.3.15).

# Listing remote objects

Much of the functionality to _list_ objects and buckets has been substantially revised.

In particular, in v3.12 execution of any request to list objects in a remote bucket further depends on whether:

1. [presence](#presence-versus-existence) == `cached`,
2. requested properties only include name, size, checksum, and/or version - ie., the props that do not involve (reading) AIS metadata.

One of the associated flows is illustrated by the following sequence diagram:

![Listing remote objects](/assets/list-objects-3.12.png)

The sequence includes 7 (seven) steps, whereby in Step 1 client is asking either for the entire contents (or, if the bucket is very large, the next page), which it then getting back in Step 7.

The rest of it must be mostly self-explanatory with, maybe, two comments:

* at Step 2 ais proxy selects one target (denoted as K) to carry out remote call
* <span style="color:green;">Steps 2, 5, and 6</span> are executed over intra-cluster network - long-lived peer-to-peer TCP connections between clustered nodes

# S3 API

In addition to the native [REST API](/docs/http_api.md), AIS also provides Amazon S3 with certain [disclosed](/docs/s3compat.md) limitations. In v3.12, the most significant changes include:

* multipart upload
* ability to operate on all buckets from all providers (previously, only s3 buckets)
* configurable root '/' access

If configured, AIS will handle S3 API calls at `gateway-IP/` endpoint (with default being `gateway-IP/s3`)

In addition, returned errors are now xml-formatted as prescribed, and [more](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/releases/tag/v1.3.15).
